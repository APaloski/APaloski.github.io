## About this page
This page is basically a giant placeholder for all things coding related that I find interesting and useful. It helps to archive blog posts I've written into useful sections.

## Code Style/Practices
The following posts are a set of posts that I've written as I read articles or watch videos related to code style and coding practices that I feel would help to improve my codes readability and maintainability. The inspiration for this was reading a good article on why using a boolean parameter is, in the long run, a harmful suggestion. Things like that belong under this header.

1. [Replace boolean parameters/returns with enum values]({{ site.base }}/coding/style/enum-vs-boolean)
2. [Prefer value types to primitive values]({{ site.base }}/coding/style/custom-value-types-vs-built-ins)

## Things I Keep Forgetting
Ever found a class that did that *exact thing* you were looking for... just 3 months later than when you needed it? These are my lists of those classes.

1. [Useful JDK classes]({{ site.base }}	/coding/tikf/useful-java-classes)
2. [Useful Java Unit Testing classes]({{ site.base }}/coding/tikf/useful-java-testing)
3. [Useful Android classes]({{ site.base }}/coding/tikf/useful-android)
